## Organize_Files_to_Folders



##### This script has been tested on the Windows environment.
#

The script first checks for admin privileges and, if not elevated it re-runs itself with admin rights.
It iterates through the current working directory and its contents. Then it makes a directory for each of the files existent in any directories and subdirectories of the current working directory, and then move the files inside them.

#



##### Requirements:

- `There are no external dependencies are required for this script. It uses only Python's standard libraries.`
