## Organize_Files_to_Folders



##### This script has been tested on the Windows environment.
#

The script first checks for admin privileges and, if not elevated, re-runs itself with admin rights.
It gets the current working directory and iterates through its contents. Then it will make a directory for each file existent in any directory and subdirectories of the current working directory.

#



##### Requirements:

- `There are no external dependencies are required for this script. It uses only Python's standard libraries.`
